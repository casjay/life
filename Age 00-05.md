### Age 0 - 5  
  
I was born December 27, 1980  
Earliest memories of childhood was my father (bozo) coming home  
drunk and/or high and throwing things or punching the wall.  
  
Really don't remember a lot at these ages...  
  
I've been told a few things but no memory...  
I had a speech impediment which took speed therapy and  
I do remember somethings during this time problaby around 4 years old  
I'm told that around the age of my behavioral problems started.  
  
I believe it wan in kindergarden that my teacher would pull my hair and drag me.  
No one believed me til another teacher caught her doing and no she wasn't fired.  
Her punishment was a transfer.
